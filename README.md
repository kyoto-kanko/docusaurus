The above blog includes technical memos as an engineer, as well as personal thoughts. Additionally, based on the knowledge and experience gained from actual work, it offers information aimed at those looking to improve their skills as engineers. I would be pleased if it could serve as a reference in some way. Should there be any incorrect content or inappropriate expressions, I would appreciate it if you could point them out.
